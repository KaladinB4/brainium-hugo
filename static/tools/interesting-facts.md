## Science & Nature

### The Immortal Jellyfish
**Turritopsis dohrnii** is a species of jellyfish that can reverse its life cycle when stressed or injured. It transforms its cells back to their earliest form (polyp) and begins life anew. In theory, this process can repeat indefinitely, making them biologically immortal.

**Why it matters:** This challenges our understanding of aging and cellular regeneration. Scientists study these jellyfish to understand stem cells and potential applications for human medicine.

### Bananas Are Radioactive
Bananas contain potassium-40, a naturally occurring radioactive isotope. Eating one banana exposes you to about 0.1 microsieverts of radiation. You'd need to eat 10 million bananas at once to die from radiation poisoning (though you'd likely die from other causes first).

**Why it matters:** This demonstrates that "radiation" isn't inherently dangerous - it's about dosage. We encounter small amounts of radiation daily from food, cosmic rays, and the environment.

## History & Culture

### The Shortest War in History
The Anglo-Zanzibar War of 1896 lasted between 38 and 45 minutes. When the Sultan of Zanzibar died, his successor was not approved by Britain. The British issued an ultimatum; when it expired, they opened fire. The Sultan's forces surrendered within an hour.

**Why it matters:** This illustrates the power imbalances of colonialism and how geopolitical conflicts can be decided rapidly when there's a massive technological disparity.

## Technology

### The First Computer Bug
In 1947, Grace Hopper found an actual moth trapped in a relay of the Harvard Mark II computer. She taped it into the logbook with the note: "First actual case of bug being found." This popularized the term "debugging" in computing.

**Why it matters:** Software bugs cost the global economy billions annually. Understanding their origin reminds us that complex systems inevitably have flaws requiring systematic identification and fixing.

## Psychology

### The Dunning-Kruger Effect
People with limited knowledge in a domain often overestimate their competence, while experts frequently underestimate theirs. This cognitive bias creates a "mount stupid" where beginners feel most confident.

**Why it matters:** Recognizing this bias helps learners stay humble, seek feedback, and understand that feeling uncertain often indicates genuine expertise developing.
