# Brainium

> Research-backed guidance for thinking with AI. We translate academic research on AI's impact on cognition into practical frameworks for knowledge workers. Our mission: Help people use AI as cognitive leverage without losing thinking skills.

Key principle: Use AI to externalize effort, not responsibility for thinking. We focus on Mode 3 (Amplification)—you think first, AI sharpens.

## Core Research

- [MIT Cognitive Debt Study](/research/mit-cognitive-debt-2025/): EEG evidence showing reduced neural connectivity when starting with AI assistance vs. brain-first writing. Brain-only writers showed 79 neural connections vs. 42 for LLM-assisted (p=0.0002).
- [Anthropic Coding Skills Study](/research/anthropic-coding-skills-2026/): RCT showing 17% skill degradation with AI assistance, highest-performing developers used zero code generation requests and focused on conceptual understanding.
- [Microsoft Critical Thinking Survey](/research/microsoft-critical-thinking-2025/): Survey of 319 knowledge workers—40% of AI tasks involved no critical thinking, driven by confidence mismatch between trust in AI vs. self.

## Practical Frameworks

- [Think First Protocol](/frameworks/think-first-protocol/): Three-phase workflow—independent thinking → AI refinement → synthesis. Based on MIT findings that starting with AI creates persistent cognitive debt.
- [Confidence Calibration Protocol](/frameworks/confidence-calibration-protocol/): Four-tactic system to maintain critical thinking through confidence tracking and task-type matching.
- [Active Prompting Protocol](/cognitive-tools/ai-assisted-learning/): Tactical approach for coding without skill degradation. Never request code without requesting understanding.

## Field Validation

- [30 Days Brain-First Writing](/field-notes/brain-first-writing-experiment/): Testing MIT's cognitive debt protocol—ownership increased from 4/10 to 8/10, memory accuracy from 40% to 85%.
- [2 Weeks Confidence Calibration](/field-notes/confidence-calibration-experiment/): 47 AI tasks logged, 3 significant errors caught that would have been missed, confidence gap narrowed over time.

## Foundation Essays

- [Why You Trust AI More Than Yourself](/essays/why-you-trust-ai-more-than-yourself/): The Confidence Paradox—critical thinking is becoming conditional on confidence calibration, not disappearing.
- [AI Makes Writing Easier—But Are We Thinking Less?](/essays/ai-makes-writing-easier/): How AI assistance changes the writing process and what that means for cognitive engagement.
- [Cognitive Offloading: 40 Years of Research](/essays/cognitive-offloading-research/): From calculators to GPS to AI—the consistent pattern of immediate gains vs. long-term skill costs.

## Philosophy & Standards

- [Core Philosophy](/about/philosophy/): Three Modes framework—Replacement (❌), Convenience (⚠️), Amplification (✅). Brainium only publishes Mode 3 content.
- [Content Standards](/docs/content-standards/): Editorial requirements including Philosophy Alignment Check and tone guidelines (curious, not alarmist).

## Optional

- [Content Marketing Funnel](/docs/content-funnel/): How TOFU → MOFU → BOFU → Retention content connects to form complete learning journeys.
- [All Research](/research/): Complete research article index with methodology and effect sizes.
- [All Essays](/essays/): Synthesis and opinion pieces connecting research to practice.
- [All Frameworks](/frameworks/): Actionable workflows for maintaining cognitive engagement.
- [All Field Notes](/field-notes/): Real experiments validating frameworks with honest results.
- [All Cognitive Tools](/cognitive-tools/): Domain-agnostic techniques (active recall, spaced repetition, deep work).
