## Content Clusters Status

Every research paper must have a **complete 4-piece cluster** following the content funnel:

| Cluster | Status | TOFU (Essay) | MOFU (Research) | BOFU (Tool) | Retention (Field Note) |
|---------|--------|--------------|-----------------|-------------|------------------------|
| **MIT/Cognitive Debt** | 100% ✅ | [AI Makes Writing Easier](/essays/ai-makes-writing-easier/) | [MIT EEG Study](/research/mit-cognitive-debt-2025/) | Think First Protocol (MIT Tactics) | [30 Days Brain-First](/field-notes/brain-first-writing-experiment/) |
| **Anthropic/Coding** | 66% ⚠️ | [Why Debugging Skills Are Disappearing](/essays/why-debugging-skills-are-disappearing/) | [Anthropic Coding Study](/research/anthropic-coding-skills-2026/) | [Active Prompting Protocol](/cognitive-tools/ai-assisted-learning/) | [TypeScript Protocol Test](/field-notes/typescript-generators-protocol-test/) |
| **Microsoft/Critical Thinking** | 100% ✅ | [Why You Trust AI More](/essays/why-you-trust-ai-more-than-yourself/) | [Microsoft Survey](/research/microsoft-critical-thinking-2025/) | [Confidence Calibration Protocol](/frameworks/confidence-calibration-protocol/) | [Confidence Calibration Test](/field-notes/confidence-calibration-experiment/) |

**Priority**: Complete Anthropic cluster (needs TOFU essay expansion)

## Quick Reference

**Content Funnel Formula**:  
`"LLM messes up X" → "Studies on X" → "Increase your X with Y"`

**Three Modes**:
- ❌ Replacement: AI thinks, you accept
- ⚠️ Convenience: AI helps, you don't challenge  
- ✅ Amplification: You think first, AI sharpens

**Quality Gates** (every piece must have):
- [ ] Maps to funnel stage
- [ ] 2+ cross-links to other content
- [ ] Clear next-step CTA
- [ ] Hugo build passes

**Key Docs**:
- `/docs/content-funnel.md` — Funnel framework
- `/docs/content-standards.md` — Editorial standards
- `/about/philosophy.md` — Three Modes framework

## Recent Decisions

1. **No field notes for human review** — Field notes require 30-day experiments. We don't run these; they must come from actual use.

2. **Maintenance Protocol deleted** — Item #7 (expanding MIT Tactic 4 into standalone framework) archived. Current Tactic 4 is sufficient.

3. **Socratic AI Tutors on hold** — Draft exists but requires human testing/validation. Pending until user feedback available.
