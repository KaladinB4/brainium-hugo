## SECTION-BY-SECTION REVIEW

### 1. MIT Cognitive Debt Article (`mit-cognitive-debt-2025.md`)

**Overall**: ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ (Excellent)

**Problem Statement Section** (lines 10-19):
- ✅ Strong hook with "neurological and cognitive consequences" 
- ✅ Stakes are clear: writing = thinking
- ⚠️ **OPPORTUNITY**: Could add 1-2 sentences about *who* this affects most (students? professionals? knowledge workers?) to increase specificity

**Research Core** (lines 22-78):
- ✅ Methodology table is scannable
- ✅ Key findings presented hierarchically (EEG → Switch Results → Behavioral)
- ✅ Critical analysis is honest about limitations (small Session 4 n=18)
- ✅ **COMPLETED**: Effect sizes added from arXiv PDF:
  - Alpha: 79 vs 42 significant connections; P7→T8 p=0.0002, dDTF: 0.053 vs 0.009
  - Theta: 65 vs 29 connections; Pz→T8 p=0.0012
  - Delta: 78 vs 31 connections; T7→AF3 p=0.0002
  - Memory: p<0.001 for quoting accuracy differences

**Practical Framework** (lines 81-109):
- ✅ "Cognitive debt" concept is clearly defined
- ✅ 3-phase model is intuitive
- ✅ Brain→LLM advantage is actionable insight
- ⚠️ **OPPORTUNITY**: Could add "Debt Recovery" subsection—how long does it take to rebuild after periods of heavy AI use?

**Tactics Section** (lines 113-167):
- ✅ All 4 tactics follow template (When/How/Why/Evidence)
- ✅ Immediately implementable
- ✅ Evidence explicitly tied to study findings
- ⚠️ **EXPANSION NODE**: Tactic 4 (Regular Unassisted Sessions) could link to a future "Maintenance Protocol" framework for sustained cognitive health

**Anti-Patterns Table** (lines 170-178):
- ✅ Clear cause-effect structure
- ✅ Alternatives are specific, not vague
- ✅ Links directly to Three Modes (Replacement/Convenience vs Amplification)

**Field Notes** (lines 182-202):
- ✅ Honest deviation documented
- ✅ Specific duration and sample size (6 sessions, 3 weeks)
- ✅ Adjustment shows framework flexibility
- ⚠️ **OPPORTUNITY**: Could quantify "more coherent argument structure"—word count? readability score? reviewer ratings?

**Quality Gate**: ✅ Passes. 30-minute implementable, all claims sourced.

---

### 2. Cognitive Offloading Essay (`cognitive-offloading-research.md`)

**Overall**: ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ (Excellent - Best Synthesis)

**Opening** (lines 14-22):
- ✅ "You've felt it" creates immediate reader resonance
- ✅ Pattern stated clearly: "Immediate performance gains. Long-term skill costs."

**Three Modes Application** (lines 147-157):
- ✅ Each mode mapped to specific offloading behavior:
  - Replacement = GPS-following
  - Convenience = Google-search
  - Amplification = worked-examples
- ✅ Ends with actionable question

**Practical Implications** (lines 161-176):
- ✅ Three principles follow research:
  1. Active Before Passive (schema building)
  2. Explicit Learning Goals (Risko & Gilbert)
  3. Retrieval Practice (memory consolidation)

**Open Questions** (lines 179-189):
- ✅ All four questions are genuinely open and research-worthy
- ✅ Question 1 (degree vs kind) is philosophically deep
- ✅ Question 3 (decade-long effects) acknowledges temporal limitation of current research

**Further Reading** (lines 205-217):
- ✅ Full citations in academic format

   - **File**: `/content/essays/socratic-ai-tutors-comparison.md`
   - **Status**: Written, builds successfully, added to essays index
   - **Thesis**: ChatGPT Study Mode and Claude Learning Mode both use Socratic methods but their implementation differences affect how well they align with research on skill acquisition
   - **Content**: ~2,100 words comparing design choices (structure, memory integration, answer toggling, coding features)
   - **Tactics**: Explanation Test, Delay Protocol, Error Preservation Rule, Mode Lock
   - **Links**: Connects to MIT cognitive debt study, Anthropic coding study, cognitive offloading essay
   - **TODO for human review**:
     - [ ] Real-world testing with actual learning scenarios
     - [ ] User experience experiments (focused tests, not 30-day)
     - [ ] Validation of design comparison claims through hands-on use
     - [ ] Feedback from actual learners using both tools
   - **Future expansion**: 30-day field experiment with both tools

5. **Field Notes: Month-Long Experiment**
   - Current field notes are anecdotal (3 weeks, 6 sessions)
   - Design rigorous 30-day protocol:
     - Week 1: Baseline (no AI)
     - Week 2: Brain-first protocol
     - Week 3: AI-heavy (Replacement mode)
     - Week 4: Recovery (Brain-first again)
     - Measure: writing quality (blind review), self-assessed understanding, time to completion
   - **Effort**: 30 days + 2 hours writing
   - **Value**: First original Brainium research, demonstrates commitment to evidence

6. **~~Microsoft Critical Thinking Survey Article~~** ✅ **COMPLETED**
   - **File**: `/content/research/microsoft-critical-thinking-2025.md`
   - **Status**: Written, builds successfully, added to research index
   - **Thesis**: Self-reported critical thinking is conditional on confidence calibration
   - **Key insight**: 40% of AI tasks involved no critical thinking, driven by confidence mismatch
   - **Tactics**: Confidence Check, Explanation Requirement, Task-Type Matching, Weekly Confidence Audit
   - **Terry Underwood critique**: Integrated as footnote [1] with full citation
   - **Links**: Connects to Anthropic study (causation), MIT study (mechanism), forming triangulation
   - **Effort**: ~3 hours research + writing
   - **Value**: Third data point—workplace prevalence across 319 knowledge workers

7. **Framework: The Maintenance Protocol**
   - Expand Tactic 4 (Regular Unassisted Sessions) into full framework
   - Include: frequency guidelines, skill-specific maintenance, recovery from cognitive debt
   - **Effort**: 3 hours
   - **Value**: Practical system for sustained cognitive health

### Long-Term (Thought Leadership)

8. **Essay: The Calculator Precedent**
   - Cognitive offloading essay covers calculators briefly
   - Deep dive on 40 years of calculator research:
     - When do they help vs hinder?
     - Grade 4 phenomenon explained
     - "Compulsion to calculate" concept
     - Implications for AI introduction timing
   - **Effort**: 6 hours
   - **Value**: Historical parallel, pedagogical insights

9. **Research: Other AI Skill Studies**
   - Search for: LLM impact on legal reasoning, medical diagnosis, financial analysis
   - Domain-specific skill degradation patterns
   - **Effort**: 8-10 hours
   - **Value**: Shows pattern consistency across professions

10. **Philosophy: Response to Critics**
   - Anticipate pushback: "You're just anti-progress" / "Tools always augment"
   - Address: extended mind debate, inevitability of AI integration, historical parallels (writing itself was once seen as cognitive decay)
   - **Effort**: 4 hours
   - **Value**: Shows intellectual honesty, inoculates against strawman arguments
