      <h2 id="the-problem">The Problem</h2>
<p>You&rsquo;re drilling geometry problems. Ten volume problems in a row, then ten surface area problems, then ten Pythagorean theorem problems. Each section feels productive—you get faster, errors drop, confidence builds. You finish feeling fluent.</p>
<p>On the test: confusion.</p>
<p>The problems are mixed. You face a volume question, then surface area, then Pythagorean. You know all three formulas. But you cannot identify which applies to which problem. You mix them up, apply the wrong approach, miss problems you practiced perfectly yesterday.</p>
<p>This is <strong>blocked practice</strong>: clustering similar problems together. It creates the illusion of mastery through short-term fluency. You stop thinking about strategy selection—the problems themselves tell you what to do. Your learning is shallow, tied to the context of the practice session rather than the underlying discrimination skill.</p>
<h2 id="the-science">The Science</h2>
<p><strong>Rohrer &amp; Taylor (2007)</strong> documented the core phenomenon. In their experiments with geometry problems, students either practiced in blocks (all volume, then all surface area) or interleaved (mixed throughout). The results reversed the usual learning curve:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>During practice</strong>: Blocked practice produced better performance (faster, fewer errors)</li>
<li><strong>One week later</strong>: Interleaved practice produced 63% accuracy vs 20% for blocked</li>
</ul>
<p>Blocked practice felt like learning but failed on transfer. Interleaving felt harder during practice but created durable, transferable skill.</p>
<p><strong>Rohrer, Dedrick &amp; Burgess (2014)</strong> replicated this in actual classrooms. Seventh-grade students received homework assignments—some mostly blocked, some mostly interleaved. On an unannounced test two weeks later:</p>
<ul>
<li>Interleaved practice: <strong>72%</strong> accuracy</li>
<li>Blocked practice: <strong>38%</strong> accuracy</li>
<li>Effect size: <strong>d = 1.05</strong> (huge)</li>
</ul>
<p>Crucially, the benefit held even when problem types were superficially dissimilar. Previous theories suggested interleaving only helped when problems looked similar (forcing discrimination). The 2014 study showed the mechanism is broader: interleaving strengthens the association between each problem type and its correct solution strategy.</p>
<p><strong>Brunmair &amp; Richter (2019)</strong> synthesized the evidence in a meta-analysis of 59 studies. Overall effect: <strong>Hedges&rsquo; g = 0.42</strong> (moderate). The effect varies by material:</p>
<ul>
<li>Visual materials (paintings, images): <strong>g = 0.67</strong> (large)</li>
<li>Mathematical tasks: <strong>g = 0.34</strong> (small-to-moderate)</li>
<li>Verbal materials: Mixed results, sometimes favoring blocking</li>
</ul>
<p>The mechanism has two components:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Discriminative contrast</strong>: Mixing forces you to choose the right strategy for each problem. Blocked practice removes this choice—the problem type is always the same.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Distributed practice</strong>: Interleaving naturally spaces out practice of each skill, providing the spacing effect as a side benefit.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>The discomfort is the signal. When you encounter a problem and cannot immediately recall the approach, you engage in effortful strategy selection. This effort creates stronger memory traces than the automatic execution blocked practice allows.</p>
<h2 id="the-tool">The Tool</h2>
<p>Interleaving is the deliberate mixing of different problem types, skills, or concepts during practice. The goal is to force <strong>discriminative contrast</strong>: the active selection of appropriate strategies rather than passive execution.</p>

<p>For mathematics and technical skills, interleaving is straightforward: scramble your problem sets. Do not organize by chapter or technique. Mix old and new material. Include problems from last week, last month, and yesterday in the same session.</p>
<p>For programming: alternate project types. Build a CLI tool, then a web scraper, then refactor legacy code, then write tests. Each switch forces you to load a different mental model and approach.</p>
<p><strong>Optimal mix ratio</strong>: Research suggests roughly equal proportions work best. Do not interleave one hard problem among ten easy ones—the contrast weakens. Aim for each practice session to contain multiple problem types in roughly equal measure.</p>
<h2 id="anti-patterns">Anti-Patterns</h2>
<p><strong>Blocking by topic.</strong> Organizing study sessions by chapter, section, or technique is the default—and it&rsquo;s wrong. The textbook structure (all quadratic equations in Chapter 3) creates the illusion of mastery. Fight it by scrambling across chapters.</p>
<p><strong>Reviewing notes before practice.</strong> If you review &ldquo;this is how to solve volume problems&rdquo; immediately before volume problems, you eliminate the discriminative challenge. Interleaving requires you to retrieve the strategy from memory, not recognize it from recent exposure.</p>
<p><strong>Over-similar problems.</strong> Interleaving works when problem types require different approaches. If problems are too similar (small variations of the same technique), mixing adds no discriminative benefit. If problems are too different (completely unrelated domains), there&rsquo;s nothing to contrast. The sweet spot is moderate similarity with distinct solution strategies.</p>
<p><strong>Giving up during difficulty.</strong> Interleaved practice feels worse than blocked. You&rsquo;re slower, make more errors, feel less fluent. This is the point. The difficulty signals effective learning. Blocked practice feels good because it bypasses the hard part—strategy selection.</p>
<h2 id="integration-with-spaced-repetition-and-active-recall">Integration with Spaced Repetition and Active Recall</h2>
<p>Interleaving completes the trinity of effective practice. Each tool addresses a different failure mode:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><a href="/cognitive-tools/spaced-repetition/">Spaced repetition</a></strong> solves the <em>when</em>: reviewing at optimal intervals</li>
<li><strong><a href="/cognitive-tools/active-recall/">Active recall</a></strong> solves the <em>how</em>: retrieving rather than recognizing</li>
<li><strong>Interleaving</strong> solves the <em>what</em>: mixing problem types to force strategy selection</li>
</ul>
<p>Together, they create <strong>spaced interleaved retrieval practice</strong>: the gold standard for skill acquisition. Review (spaced) by testing yourself (active recall) on mixed problem types (interleaving).</p>
<p>With AI-assisted learning, interleaving is particularly powerful. AI tools excel at generating varied problems. Instead of drilling one pattern, request mixed problem sets:</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>&#34;Give me 10 problems mixing:
- Two from yesterday&#39;s React hooks lesson
- Two from last week&#39;s API design
- Two from last month&#39;s database optimization
- Four new variations combining these&#34;
</code></pre><p>This forces the AI to challenge your discriminative ability while providing the <a href="/cognitive-tools/ai-assisted-learning/#phase-3-verification-after-code">explanation test</a> opportunity for each problem type.</p>
<h2 id="quick-start">Quick Start</h2>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Audit your current practice.</strong> If you&rsquo;re organizing by topic, chapter, or technique, you&rsquo;re blocking. Stop.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Create mixed problem sets.</strong> For your next study session, include problems from three different topics you&rsquo;ve learned in the past month. Do not group them—interleave randomly.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Remove cues.</strong> Do not label problems by type. Do not review the relevant chapter first. Force yourself to identify the appropriate approach for each problem.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Track strategy selection time.</strong> Measure how long it takes to identify which technique applies. This metric (not execution speed) indicates whether you&rsquo;re building discriminative skill.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Embrace the difficulty.</strong> Interleaving feels slower and more error-prone. This is correct. Blocked practice feels fluent because it&rsquo;s bypassing the learning.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>After two weeks of interleaved practice versus blocked, test yourself on mixed problems. The gap will be visible. After one month, it will be dramatic. After six months, blocked practice will have decayed; interleaved practice will have strengthened.</p>
