**Status: Framework in Development**

This framework is currently being developed and tested. The core principles are established, but detailed implementation guides, templates, and checklists are coming soon.

## Core Concept

The Think First Protocol addresses the fundamental tension identified in [MIT's cognitive debt study](/research/mit-cognitive-debt-2025/): **starting with AI assistance reduces neural engagement and creates skill deficits that persist even when returning to unassisted work.**

The protocol establishes a simple rule: **never request AI assistance before you've done your own thinking.**

## The Three-Phase Structure

### Phase 1: Independent Thinking (Required)
**Duration:** Minimum 20-30 minutes

Before opening any AI tool:
- Write your own outline
- Draft your initial thoughts
- Identify what you don't understand
- Formulate specific questions

**Success metric:** Can you explain your current thinking without looking at notes?

### Phase 2: AI-Assisted Refinement
**Mode:** AI as consultant, not replacement

Once you've established your own foundation:
- Ask AI to critique your approach
- Request alternative perspectives
- Use AI to fill specific knowledge gaps
- Challenge AI outputs that don't match your reasoning

### Phase 3: Synthesis & Verification
**Goal:** Ensure ownership of final output

After AI assistance:
- Close AI tools
- Summarize key points from memory
- Explain the solution to someone else (or a blank page)
- Verify you can reconstruct the reasoning without AI

## Why This Matters

The [MIT study](/research/mit-cognitive-debt-2025/) found that participants who started with AI showed:
- 42 neural connections (alpha band) vs 79 for brain-only writers
- Lower memory retention of their own content
- Reduced sense of ownership over their work
- Persistent under-engagement when returning to unassisted writing

The Think First Protocol inverts this pattern by establishing cognitive foundations before introducing assistance.

## Coming Soon

**Full Implementation Guide**
- Step-by-step workflow for different task types (writing, coding, analysis)
- Decision trees for when to use AI vs. when to persist independently
- Time-based minimums and progress checkpoints

**Templates & Checklists**
- Pre-AI thinking checklist
- AI interaction log template
- Post-AI verification checklist
- Weekly audit template

**Troubleshooting Guide**
- "I'm stuck after 10 minutes—should I use AI?"
- "How to handle urgent deadlines while maintaining protocol"
- "Signs you're slipping into AI-first habits"

**Integration with Other Tools**
- Combining with [Active Recall](/cognitive-tools/active-recall/) for verification
- Using with [Spaced Repetition](/cognitive-tools/spaced-repetition/) for long-term retention
- Pairing with [Deep Work](/cognitive-tools/deep-work/) sessions

## Early Principles (Available Now)

While the full framework is in development, these principles from the [companion essay](/essays/ai-makes-writing-easier/) can be applied immediately:

1. **The 25-Minute Rule:** Set a timer for 25 minutes of unassisted work before any AI use
2. **The Explanation Test:** Before accepting AI help, articulate what you're trying to achieve
3. **The Ownership Check:** Close AI and summarize what you learned without looking
