**Status: Method Documentation in Progress**

Detailed implementation guides and templates for the teach-back method are under development. Core principles and research foundation outlined below.

## The Core Insight

Teaching is one of the most effective learning mechanisms known. When you explain something to someone else—or attempt to—you're forced to:
- Organize your understanding
- Identify logical gaps
- Synthesize complex concepts
- Articulate implicit knowledge

The MIT cognitive debt study found that AI users struggled to quote their own work. The teach-back method addresses this by forcing consolidation.

## Why It Works with AI-Assisted Learning

AI can provide excellent explanations. But consuming an explanation is not the same as owning it. The teach-back method creates a **generative checkpoint**:

1. AI explains a concept
2. You attempt to teach it back
3. Gaps in your understanding become obvious
4. You return to AI to address specific gaps
5. Repeat until you can teach it fluently

## Three Variants

### Variant 1: The Voice Memo
**Best for:** Quick verification after AI sessions
**Process:**
- Close AI tool
- Record 2-3 minute voice memo explaining what you learned
- Listen to it—does it make sense?
- Note any hesitations or contradictions

### Variant 2: The Written Explanation  
**Best for:** Complex topics requiring structure
**Process:**
- Write a one-page explanation for a beginner
- Include analogies and examples
- Identify where you got stuck
- Return to AI to clarify stuck points

### Variant 3: The Live Teaching
**Best for:** Maximum accountability and feedback
**Process:**
- Schedule 15 minutes with a colleague or friend
- Teach them the concept
- Answer their questions
- Note what you couldn't explain clearly
