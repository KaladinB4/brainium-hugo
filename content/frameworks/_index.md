## Frameworks

Frameworks are structured workflows that translate research insights into daily practice. Unlike general principles, these provide step-by-step guidance for specific scenarios.

### Available Frameworks

**[Think First Protocol](/frameworks/think-first-protocol/)** — *In Development*
A three-phase workflow for maintaining cognitive ownership: independent thinking → AI-assisted refinement → synthesis & verification. Based on MIT's finding that starting with AI creates persistent cognitive debt.

**[Retrieval Practice Guide](/frameworks/retrieval-practice-guide/)** — *Complete*
Comprehensive guide to retrieval practice in AI-assisted workflows. Research-backed techniques that produce 50-60% better retention than re-reading. Pre-AI retrieval, post-AI summarization, and teach-back methods for information ownership.

**[Teach-Back Method](/frameworks/teach-back-method/)** — *In Development*
Leverage the protégé effect to solidify understanding. Teaching reveals gaps that passive consumption hides.
**[Confidence Calibration Protocol](/frameworks/confidence-calibration-protocol/)** — *New*
A four-tactic system for maintaining critical thinking through confidence tracking and task-type matching. Based on Microsoft's research showing confidence mismatch drives analytical engagement.

## Framework Development Pipeline

These frameworks are in active development. Current status:

- **Core concepts:** Defined and documented
- **Implementation guides:** Coming soon
- **Templates & checklists:** In testing
- **Field notes:** [Contributions welcome](/about/)

## Relationship to Other Content

**Frameworks vs. Cognitive Tools:**
- [Cognitive Tools](/cognitive-tools/) are domain-agnostic mental techniques (active recall, spaced repetition)
- Frameworks are specific workflows for AI-assisted work (think first, then use AI)

**Frameworks vs. Research:**
- [Research articles](/research/) establish what the science shows
- Frameworks show how to apply it in practice

**The integration:** Research → Frameworks → Cognitive Tools = Complete system for AI-assisted learning
