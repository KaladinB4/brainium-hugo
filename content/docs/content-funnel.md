# Brainium Content Marketing Funnel

---

## 1. The Funnel Architecture

Brainium's existing content structure maps perfectly to the classic content marketing funnel:

| Funnel Stage | Purpose | Brainium Format | Content Goal | CTAs |
|--------------|---------|-----------------|--------------|------|
| **TOFU** (Top) | Problem Awareness | Essays | Trigger recognition | "See the research on this" |
| **MOFU** (Middle) | Education/Consideration | Research Articles | Evidence + frameworks | "Get the solution" |
| **BOFU** (Bottom) | Solution/Action | Cognitive Tools | Implementation | "See it in action" |
| **Retention** | Engagement/Proof | Field Notes | Validation + velocity | "Try the next framework" |

**The Formula:**
```
"LLM messes up X" → "Studies on X" → "Increase your X with Y"
```

---

## 2. Content Clusters

Every major research area requires a **complete 4-piece cluster**:

```
TOPIC: [Domain] + AI Impact

Essay (TOFU): "[Problem] is getting worse with AI"
   ↓ links to
Research (MOFU): "[Study] on [Domain] with AI"  
   ↓ links to
Tool (BOFU): "[Framework] for [Domain]"
   ↓ links to
Field Note: "I tried [Framework] for 30 days"
```

### Current Cluster Status

| Research Base | Essay (TOFU) | Tool (BOFU) | Field Note | Status |
|--------------|--------------|-------------|------------|---------|
| MIT/Cognitive Debt | ✅ "AI Makes Writing Easier" | ⚠️ Partial | ❌ Missing | **75%** |
| Anthropic/Coding | ⚠️ Partial | ✅ Active Prompting Protocol | ❌ Missing | **66%** |
| Microsoft/Critical Thinking | ❌ Missing | ❌ Missing | ❌ Missing | **0%** |

**Priority:** Complete existing clusters before building new ones.

## 3. Editorial Standards by Stage

### TOFU (Essays)
- **Hook:** Personal observation or industry pain point
- **Requirement:** Reference research within first 200 words
- **Length:** 1500-2000 words
- **Tone:** Curious, not alarmist
- **Must include:** Link to related Research article

### MOFU (Research Articles)
- **Hook:** Specific surprising finding
- **Requirement:** Extract named framework (2-4 words)
- **Must include:** "Practical Extraction" section
- **Length:** 1200-1800 words
- **Must include:** Links to related Cognitive Tool + application guidance

### BOFU (Cognitive Tools)
- **Hook:** Common failure mode
- **Requirement:** Implementable in 30 minutes
- **Must include:** Anti-patterns table
- **Must include:** Links to 2+ supporting Research articles
- **Length:** 800-1200 words
- **Must include:** "See this in action" → Field Notes

### Field Notes (Retention Layer)
- **Hook:** What you tried and why
- **Requirement:** Reference specific framework/tool
- **Must include:** Honest results (including failures)
- **Must include:** Suggest next framework to try
- **Length:** 600-1000 words
- **Frequency:** 1-2 per month minimum

## 4. Cross-Linking Requirements

Every piece must answer: Where does the reader go next?

**Required Click Paths:**

| From | To | CTA Template |
|------|-----|--------------|
| Essay | Research | "The [Institution] study measured exactly this. Read the breakdown →" |
| Research | Tool | "The solution: [Named Framework]. See the protocol →" |
| Tool | Field Notes | "I tested this for a month. Here's what happened (including what failed) →" |
| Field Notes | Next Topic | "Next: I applied this to [related domain]. Follow along →" |

**Cross-Reference Density:**
- Minimum 2 internal links per article
- Every Research article links to at least 1 other Research article
- Every Tool links to at least 2 Research articles
- Every Field Note links to its parent Tool and Research

## 5. Content Calendar Priorities

### Phase 1: Complete Existing Clusters (Next 30 Days)
1. Write Field Note for MIT/Cognitive Debt cluster
2. Write Field Note for Anthropic/Coding cluster  
3. Write Essay for Microsoft/Critical Thinking cluster

### Phase 2: Build New Clusters (Next 90 Days)
Priority topics based on research availability:
- Spatial memory/GPS pattern (research exists)
- Mathematical reasoning/calculator studies (research exists)
- Reading comprehension/summarization (emerging research)

### Phase 3: Velocity Layer (Ongoing)
- **Field Notes:** 2 per month (quick experiments)
- **Essays:** 1 per month (problem awareness)
- **Research:** 1 per quarter (deep credibility)
- **Tools:** 1 per quarter (solution expansion)

## 6. Quality Gates

Before publishing any piece:

- [ ] Maps clearly to a funnel stage
- [ ] Links to at least 2 other pieces
- [ ] Has a clear next-step CTA
- [ ] **If TOFU:** Leads to MOFU content
- [ ] **If MOFU:** Extracts a framework and links to BOFU
- [ ] **If BOFU:** References supporting research
- [ ] **If Field Note:** Validates a specific framework

---

## 7. Why This Matters

**Without the funnel:** Brainium publishes excellent research that readers consume passively. No conversion, no retention, no action.

**With the funnel:** Every piece has a job. Essays create awareness, Research builds authority, Tools drive action, Field Notes prove it works and create content velocity.

**The metric that matters:** Funnel completion rate (readers who progress from TOFU → MOFU → BOFU).
