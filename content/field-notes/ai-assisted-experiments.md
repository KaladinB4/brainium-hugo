## Active Experiments

### Spaced Repetition + AI Assistance
**Research question:** Can spaced repetition counteract the memory deficits observed in [MIT's cognitive debt study](/research/mit-cognitive-debt-2025/)?

**Hypothesis:** Regular retrieval practice will improve retention of AI-assisted learning compared to passive AI use alone.

**Method:**
- Learning sessions using AI assistance
- Immediate retrieval practice (explain without notes)
- Spaced review at 1 day, 3 days, 7 days, 14 days
- Comparison of recall rates vs. baseline

**Status:** Week 3 of 8-week protocol
**Initial observations:** [Coming soon]

## Proposed Experiments

### Think First Protocol Field Test
Test the [Think First Protocol](/frameworks/think-first-protocol/) across different domains:
- Technical writing (documentation, proposals)
- Coding and software development
- Research and analysis
- Creative writing

**Metrics:**
- Time to completion
- Self-assessed understanding
- Ability to reproduce without AI
- Long-term retention (1-week test)

### Confidence Calibration Tracking
Based on [Microsoft's critical thinking research](/research/microsoft-critical-thinking-2025/), track confidence dynamics over time:
- Daily confidence ratings (self vs. AI)
- Instances of verification behavior
- Drift toward over-reliance
- Effect of awareness on behavior
