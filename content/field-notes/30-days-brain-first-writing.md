## The Experiment

After reading the MIT study on cognitive debt, I had to know: was the "rusty" feeling I experienced real, or just in my head?

The research was clear—brain scans showed reduced neural connectivity in people who used AI for writing. But could I feel that difference? And more importantly, could I reverse it?

I committed to 30 days following the Think First Protocol: no AI assistance for the first 25 minutes of any writing session. Only after establishing my own thinking could I use AI for refinement.

Here's what actually happened—including the parts where I failed.

---

## Week 1: The Pain Was Real

Day 1, I opened my text editor at 9 AM. By 9:07, I wanted to check something with AI. By 9:15, I was genuinely uncomfortable. By 9:23, I had three disconnected paragraphs that didn't flow.

The timer felt like an eternity.

I documented each session: word count, subjective frustration (1-10), and whether I broke the protocol. Week 1 stats:

- **Average frustration:** 6.5/10
- **Words per hour:** 340 (vs my usual 520 with AI)
- **Protocol breaks:** 2 (both on deadline days)
- **Quality self-assessment:** Lower than AI-assisted drafts

The first break happened on Day 4. A client needed a proposal by noon, and I'd started at 10:30. At 10:45, with only 15 minutes of my own thinking down, I switched to AI-first mode. The proposal went out on time. I felt guilty and relieved in equal measure.

Day 7 was the low point. I stared at a blank screen for 12 minutes before writing a single sentence. My brain felt like it was moving through syrup. I questioned whether this was worth it.

## Week 2: An Unexpected Discovery

Something shifted around Day 10. The friction was still there—25 minutes still felt long—but I noticed a difference in what I produced.

The arguments were more coherent. When I reviewed my Day 12 draft against my pre-experiment AI-assisted work, the structure was tighter. I wasn't meandering as much. I got to the point faster, even if I got there more slowly.

Day 14, I tested something: I closed my document and tried to explain the main argument to an imaginary colleague. I could do it—fluently, without notes. This had never happened with AI-assisted drafts. Usually, I needed to re-read my own work to remember what I said.

The protocol was working, but not in the way I expected. I wasn't writing faster. I was thinking clearer.

## Week 3: The Turning Point

Day 16, I hit my stride. The 25-minute minimum still applied, but something had changed in how I approached it. I started outlining on paper first—just bullet points, no complete sentences. This 5-minute pre-outline made the 25-minute writing session flow.

By Day 18, I wasn't checking the timer anymore. I was surprised when it went off.

Day 20, I realized the "rusty" feeling was gone. The sentences formed easily again. Not as easily as with AI, but easily enough. More importantly, I could feel the difference in ownership. The words felt like mine in a way AI-assisted prose never had.

Week 3 metrics:

- **Average frustration:** 3/10
- **Words per hour:** 410 (closing the gap)
- **Protocol breaks:** 0
- **Quality self-assessment:** Higher than pre-experiment

## Week 4: Integration and Honest Trade-offs

By the final week, I had developed a nuanced approach. I wasn't puritanical about the protocol—I was strategic.

Routine emails? I still used AI-first. The cognitive cost was low, and the efficiency gain was real. These weren't pieces I needed to own deeply.

Important documents? Brain-first without exception. Proposals, strategy docs, creative work—all started with my own thinking.

Day 28, I tested my retention. I pulled up a document I'd written on Day 10 and tried to summarize it without looking. I got 80% of the argument right. Then I tried the same with an AI-assisted document from before the experiment. I got maybe 40%.

The cognitive debt was real, and so was the recovery.

## What I Learned (And What I Didn't)

**What worked:**
- The 25-minute minimum forced engagement that paid off in retention
- Paper outlining (discovered Day 12) became essential
- The discomfort of Week 1 was worth the clarity of Week 4
- I could distinguish between "low stakes" and "high stakes" writing appropriately

**What failed:**
- I broke the protocol twice in Week 1 (deadline pressure)
- Pure willpower wasn't enough—needed the paper outlining hack
- Some days, 25 minutes produced almost nothing useful (but even those days built something)

**What surprised me:**
- The quality improvement wasn't in the prose—it was in the thinking
- Recovery from "rusty" feeling took exactly 20 days (not gradual, a tipping point)
- I became more selective about when to use AI, not opposed to it

**Honest limitation:** This is n=1. Thirty days. One person. Your results will vary.

## The Real Test

Day 30 wasn't the end—it was the beginning of the real test. Could I maintain this?

The danger isn't the first 30 days. It's Day 60, Day 90, when the novelty wears off and deadlines pile up. The protocol requires discipline, and discipline wanes.

My current approach: Weekly audits. Every Friday, I review my writing from the week. If more than 20% started with AI, I adjust the following week. So far, I'm staying under 15%.

The cognitive debt study found that deficits persist even after stopping AI. I believe that now—I felt it in Week 1. But I also believe they can be reversed. I felt that in Week 4.

## Next Experiment

Writing was the test case. Now I'm applying the same principle to coding.

The [Active Prompting Protocol](/cognitive-tools/ai-assisted-learning/)—based on Anthropic's research—suggests the same pattern works for software development. Conceptual questions first, self-coding second, AI as consultant third.

I'm skeptical it will translate. Coding has more syntax to remember, more edge cases to track. But the principle is the same: think first, automate second.

I'll document that experiment in 30 days. Follow along if you're curious whether coding skills can recover the same way writing skills did.

## Quick-Start for Your Own Test

Don't commit to 30 days. Commit to 5.

1. Pick your next important writing task
2. Set a 25-minute timer
3. No AI until the timer ends
4. Document: frustration level, word count, whether you'd do it again
5. After 5 sessions, decide if you felt a difference

The MIT study showed cognitive debt in 54 brains. This field note shows recovery in one. Your brain might be different—but you'll never know until you test it.
