Field Notes document real applications of Brainium frameworks. These are honest experiments—what worked, what failed, and what we learned.

## Latest Field Notes

**[30 Days Testing Active Prompting for Coding](/field-notes/30-days-active-prompting-coding/)** — I applied the Active Prompting Protocol to learning Rust async patterns. The first two weeks were brutal. By day 18, I could debug without AI assistance—something I hadn't done in years.

**[30 Days of Brain-First Writing: Testing the Cognitive Debt Protocol](/field-notes/30-days-brain-first-writing/)** — I committed to 30 days of writing without AI for the first 25 minutes. The first two weeks were painful. By week four, I could feel my brain working differently—and I could prove it with a retention test.

**[AI-Assisted Learning Experiments](/field-notes/ai-assisted-experiments/)** — Ongoing structured experiments testing Brainium frameworks in practice.
- Spaced Repetition + AI: Can retrieval practice counteract cognitive debt?
- Think First Protocol: Field testing across multiple domains
- Confidence Calibration: Tracking drift toward AI over-reliance

**[Learning TypeScript Generators](/field-notes/typescript-generators-protocol-test/)** — *Coming soon* Applying the Active Prompting Protocol while learning a complex language feature.

Field Notes validate the research-backed frameworks with real-world experiments. They also serve as the bridge from theory (Research) to practice (Cognitive Tools) to proof (Field Notes).
