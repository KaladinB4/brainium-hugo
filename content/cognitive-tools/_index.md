Cognitive tools are the instruments we use to shape how information moves through our minds. Unlike productivity hacks, these are grounded in decades of research on memory formation, skill acquisition, and cognitive load management.

The tools here share three characteristics:

1. **Research-backed**: Each technique has experimental validation, not just anecdotal support
2. **Implementation-agnostic**: You can apply them with paper, apps, or mental discipline alone
3. **Complementary**: They work together—spaced repetition pairs with active recall, deep work requires attention management

## Core Tools

- **[AI-Assisted Learning](/cognitive-tools/ai-assisted-learning/)** — Using AI coding assistants without cognitive offloading. Based on Anthropic's research on high-performing interaction patterns.
- **[Spaced Repetition](/cognitive-tools/spaced-repetition/)** — The 10-20% rule for permanent memory. Based on Cepeda's 1,350-person study and Duolingo's algorithm research.
- **[Active Recall](/cognitive-tools/active-recall/)** — Testing as learning. Based on Roediger & Karpicke's test-enhanced learning research.
- **[Interleaving](/cognitive-tools/interleaving/)** — Mixing problem types for mastery. Based on Rohrer's classroom research showing 72% vs 38% performance.
- **[Deep Work](/cognitive-tools/deep-work/)** — Sustained attention as prerequisite for all learning. Based on Leroy's attention residue research and Mark's interruption studies.
- **[Diffused Mode](/cognitive-tools/diffused-mode/)** — Strategic breaks for insight generation. Based on Oakley's focused/diffuse modes and Dijksterhuis's unconscious thought theory.

Each tool includes the research foundation, practical implementation options, common anti-patterns, and quick-start guides. Use them individually or as an integrated system.
