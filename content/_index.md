title: "Brainium — Research-Backed Guidance for Thinking with AI"
description: "Practical frameworks for cognitive leverage in the AI era. Translating research into actionable strategies for learning with AI without losing your edge."

AI can write your code, explain your concepts, and debug your errors. But something unexpected is happening: we're getting worse at the very skills AI is helping with.

Brainium translates cutting-edge research into practical frameworks—so you can use AI as leverage without losing the thinking skills that matter.

## Latest Research

**[AI Makes Writing Easier—But Are We Thinking Less?](/essays/ai-makes-writing-easier/)** — A personal essay on discovering that AI writing assistance had changed how my brain works—and what MIT's brain imaging research reveals about "cognitive debt" that persists even when the AI is gone.

**[MIT's Cognitive Debt Study](/research/mit-cognitive-debt-2025/)** — Brain scans of 54 participants show that LLM users display weaker neural connectivity than those writing without tools—and the deficit persists even after switching back to unassisted writing.

**[Anthropic's Coding Study](/research/anthropic-coding-skills-2026/)** — A randomized trial of 52 developers found AI assistance reduced mastery scores by 17%—but only for certain interaction patterns. Learn which AI use modes preserve skills and which degrade them.

**[Cognitive Offloading: The 40-Year Pattern](/essays/cognitive-offloading-research/)** — From calculators to GPS to ChatGPT—research shows we've been here before. The question isn't whether AI changes cognition, but whether we can use it without losing the ability to think.

## The Brainium Approach

We focus on:

- **Research synthesis** over hot takes
- **Cognitive frameworks** over tool lists  
- **Skill development** over speed
- **Understanding** over output

**[Read our Core Philosophy](/about/philosophy/)** — The Three Modes framework (Replacement, Convenience, Amplification), the Brainium Principle, and the standards we hold every article to.

## What We Do

**Research Synthesis**: Breaking down studies on AI's impact on cognition, learning, and skill development into actionable insights.

**Framework Development**: Building practical mental models for using AI productively—without cognitive offloading.

**Field Testing**: Documenting real experiments in learning with AI, with honest results.
