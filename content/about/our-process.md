## Our Stance on AI-Assisted Writing

We research and write about AI's impact on cognition. It would be hypocritical to use AI carelessly in that writing.

This page documents exactly how we use AI tools to produce Brainium content—following the same principles we advocate for: Amplification Mode, not Replacement Mode.

---

## The Core Principle: Amplification, Not Replacement

Every article on Brainium follows this workflow:

1. **Human Research First:** We read the full papers, extract findings, identify limitations
2. **Human Outline:** Editor creates structure and argument flow
3. **AI Expansion (Supervised):** AI drafts sections based on detailed prompts
4. **Human Edit:** Editor rewrites for tone, accuracy, flow
5. **Fact Check:** All claims verified against original sources
6. **Review:** Final pass for editorial standards

**The rule:** AI never generates without human input. AI never fact-checks itself. AI never publishes without human review.

## Disclosure Statement

Every article drafted with AI assistance includes this note in its metadata:

> "Drafted with AI assistance following Brainium's Amplification Mode protocol. All research claims verified against original sources."

---

## Specific Prompts We Use

### Research Extraction Prompt

"Summarize findings from [paper]. List: key results with effect sizes, methodology strengths, explicit limitations mentioned by authors, related work connections. Do not add interpretation beyond the paper's claims."

### Drafting Prompt

"Expand this outline into prose following Brainium style: [outline]. Tone: curious not alarmist, practical not preachy. Include specific tactics with examples. Cite effect sizes where relevant."

### Editing Prompt

"Review this draft for: tone consistency (curious not alarmist), claim accuracy (does it match the source material?), clarity for non-expert readers, scannable structure with headers and bullets."

## Why This Matters

If we're writing about cognitive debt—the cost of outsourcing thinking—we must demonstrate we avoid it.

Our process:
- **Preserves human research and judgment** (cognitive engagement)
- **Uses AI for efficiency in drafting** (externalizing effort, not responsibility)
- **Maintains accountability through verification** (human remains in charge)

This is the Brainium Principle in practice: *Use AI to externalize effort, not responsibility for thinking.*

---

## Human-Only Content

Some content is created entirely without AI assistance:

- **Field notes** — Personal experiments and observations
- **Philosophy essays** — Core values and framework development
- **Editorial opinions** — Stance pieces on AI and cognition

These are marked with: "Human-written. No AI assistance."

## For Contributors

If you're writing for Brainium, follow this process or document your alternative. We welcome diverse approaches, but not pure AI generation without human oversight.

**Requirements for contributors:**
- Read the full-text of any research you cite
- Verify effect sizes against original sources
- Disclose AI assistance in your submission
- Maintain the tone: curious, not alarmist

[Contact us](/about/) for contributor guidelines.

## Questions?

This process will evolve as we learn. If you have questions about our approach or suggestions for improvement, we'd love to hear them.

The goal isn't perfection—it's transparency. We believe readers deserve to know how their information is produced, especially when that information is about how AI changes cognition.
