Brainium is a research translation project. We read the papers, run the experiments, and extract what actually matters for people learning and working with AI.

## What We Do

**Research Synthesis**: Breaking down studies on AI's impact on cognition, learning, and skill development into actionable insights.

**Framework Development**: Building practical mental models for using AI productively—without cognitive offloading.

**Field Testing**: Documenting real experiments in learning with AI, with honest results.

## Our Stance

We're not anti-AI. We're pro-intelligence.

The goal isn't to avoid AI tools. It's to use them in ways that amplify rather than replace your thinking.

**Read our full [Core Philosophy](/about/philosophy/)** — including the Three Modes framework and the standards we hold ourselves to.
