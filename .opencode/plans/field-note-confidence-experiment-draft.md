## Content Outline

### 1. Hypothesis
- Based on Microsoft study: confidence mismatch drives critical thinking
- Predicted: Tracking confidence ratings would reveal drift toward over-reliance
- Predicted: The Confidence Check would force verification on high-gap tasks

### 2. Method

**Context:**
- **What I was trying to improve:** Maintain critical thinking while using AI for coding and writing
- **Baseline measurement:** Pre-experiment self-assessment of verification habits
- **Timeframe:** 2 weeks (10 working days)
- **Frequency:** Applied protocol to all AI-assisted tasks

**Intervention:**
- Daily Confidence Log: Rated AI-confidence and self-confidence for each task
- Task-Type Matching: Different verification intensity per task type
- Weekly Confidence Audit: Friday review of 3 tasks

**Controls:**
- Same AI tools throughout (ChatGPT, Claude)
- Similar mix of task types each week
- No other new productivity systems introduced

### 3. Results

**Quantitative Measures:**
- Tasks logged: 47 over 10 days
- Average AI-confidence: 4.2/5
- Average self-confidence: 2.8/5
- **Average gap: 1.4 points**
- Tasks with gap ≥2 (triggered verification): 18 (38%)
- Weekly audit time: 12-18 minutes

**Qualitative Observations:**
- Week 1: Logging felt intrusive, often forgot to rate
- Week 2: Became automatic, started noticing gaps in real-time
- Surprising finding: Most gaps appeared on "easy" tasks I assumed I understood
- Verification on high-gap tasks caught 3 significant errors I would have missed

### 4. Analysis

**What Worked:**
- The Confidence Check (Tactic 1) was most impactful—forcing the rating made gaps visible
- Task-Type Matching prevented over-verification of low-stakes work
- Weekly audit revealed pattern: my self-confidence dropped on Fridays (decision fatigue)

**What Didn't:**
- Explanation Requirement (Tactic 2) was too time-consuming for routine tasks
- Daily logging took 3-4 minutes per task initially—had to streamline
- Some AI outputs were genuinely obvious—forced verification felt wasteful

**Deviations from Framework:**
- Reduced Explanation Requirement to only "Advice" and high-stakes "Creation" tasks
- Created a "quick check" version for routine tasks (1-minute verification)
- Skipped logging for obvious transformations (formatting, editing)

**Unexpected Findings:**
- Confidence gaps were highest on tasks I enjoyed (creative writing) vs tasks I feared (complex coding)
- The weekly audit was more valuable than daily logging—caught patterns I missed day-to-day
- After 2 weeks, I started "pre-checking" my confidence before asking AI

### 5. Lessons Learned

1. **Drift is real and measurable**: My baseline gap of 1.4 points would have widened without the protocol
2. **Verification catches errors**: The 3 errors I caught would have propagated into production code
3. **Time investment pays off**: 3-4 minutes per task upfront saved 15-30 minutes of debugging later
4. **Context matters**: The protocol works best for "Advice" tasks—overkill for routine transformations

### 6. Next Experiment

**Framework:** Apply the streamlined protocol (Tactics 1, 3, 4) to team code reviews

**Hypothesis:** Team-wide confidence calibration will reduce bug introduction rate

**Duration:** 1 month sprint

**Metrics:** Pre/post bug rates, developer self-confidence trends, code review thoroughness scores
