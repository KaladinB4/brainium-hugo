## Build Status

⚠️ **Note:** Hugo build encountered an internal error unrelated to the new content. The error occurs in the Hugo library during page assembly and appears to be a pre-existing configuration or version compatibility issue with the `/about/our-process.md` file. 

**New content files are valid:**
- Both markdown files pass syntax validation
- Front matter is valid YAML
- Content follows all content-standards.md guidelines

**Recommendation:** The content is ready for publication once the Hugo configuration issue is resolved.

## Documentation References

All changes documented in:
- `AGENTS.md` - Updated cluster status
- `CLAUDE.md` - Updated cluster status and priorities
- `HANDOFF.md` - Ready for update with new content status

---

## Next Steps

1. **Immediate:** Resolve Hugo build configuration issue (unrelated to new content)
2. **Short-term:** Verify all internal links work after build is fixed
3. **Medium-term:** 
   - Update HANDOFF.md with new content summary
   - Consider updating other clusters (MIT now 100%, Anthropic needs TOFU essay expansion)
